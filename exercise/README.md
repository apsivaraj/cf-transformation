# Application Migration Exercises

These exercises provide step-by-step instructions on how to use the Cloud Foundry migration tool to migrate a variety of sample applications to three different target cloud platforms. The sample application types are:

- Java using the `ibm-websphere-liberty` buildpack
- Java Springboot using the `java` (Tomcat) buildpack
- Node.js using the `nodejs` buildpack
 
The exercises below describe migrating each of the application types above to their respective cloud platform:

- [OpenShift](openshift.md)
- [IBM Kubernetes Service](iks.md)
