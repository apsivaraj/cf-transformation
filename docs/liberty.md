# IBM WebSphere Liberty

The liberty tool generates the following configuration files:

- server.xml (new or modified from existing)
- runtime-vars.xml (extracted environment variables from VCAP_SERVICES)

You may want to modify the runtime-vars.xml manually as necessary to attach to different backend services.
Also the JDBC drivers and datasources that are typically automatically generated by the buildpack are not created by the tool. You should provide these information in the server.xml file.
